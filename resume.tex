\actionHeader{Radii of Star Clusters}{}
\actionHeaderSecondLine{\href{https://github.com/gillenbrown/LEGUS-sizes}{github.com/gillenbrown/LEGUS-sizes}}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used a Bayesian model to measure the radii of star clusters seen in Hubble Space Telescope images
    \item Successfully measured the radii of over 6,000 star clusters, more than all previous studies combined
